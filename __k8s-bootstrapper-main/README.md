# Kubernetes Bootstrapper: An Extendable Framework to Set Up Production-Grade Clusters

## Introduction

"*Production-grade*" is a loaded term. What constitutes production readiness will vary according to your use case. While a Kubernetes cluster is production-ready the moment it is ready to serve traffic, there is a commonly agreed set of minimum requirements, as shown in the infographic below.

With [many cloud-native solutions](https://landscape.cncf.io/) popping up daily, it can be pretty daunting for engineers and organizations to choose the "right" tools to build their tech. Integrating them to get to **day-2 operations ready** in Kubernetes becomes all the more challenging.

## Kubernetes Bootstrapper

The [**k8s-bootstrapper**](https://github.com/hivenetes/k8s-bootstrapper) project is a customizable and extendable framework that aims to solve this problem by leveraging

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): Compose a production-ready infrastructure on DigitalOcean
- [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): Application configuration management and delivery using GitOps

This project integrates popular battle-tested open-source software and solutions that provide a production-grade out-of-box Kubernetes experience.

###  Target Audience

- Kubernetes adopters
- Startups/SMBs who are looking to speed up the Kubernetes adoption
- Builders and curious souls

###  Bootstrap the Kubernetes Cluster

Follow the guide in the order stated below:

1. [DigitalOcean Infrastructure Automation via Terraform](./infrastructure/terraform/README.md)
2. [Bootstrapping using Argo CD](./bootstrap/README.md)
3. [Set up Observability using Robusta](./observability/README.md)

Here is the overview of the architecture that we will set up:

Intended for experimentation/evaluation only.
You will be responsible for all infrastructure costs incurred by the used resources.

###  Tear down the Bootstrapped Cluster

Had fun trying out the *k8s-bootstrapper*? Time to say goodbye!

```bash
# Run
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform destroy --var-file=bootstrapper.tfvars --auto-approve
# Bye Bye!
```
